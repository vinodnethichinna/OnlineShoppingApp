# Online Shopping Application.

Hi, This project is about Online Shopping Application.Please find the proposal below.

Mobile Application Development Project Proposal.

Online Shopping Application.

The main functionality of the application is to order online by adding items to the cart and ordering them later. The app contains activities like Login, Registration, Cart and Wishlist. The new user will have ability to register and the existing user has an ability to login using the email and password credentials. The user has an additional option of removing items from the cart before proceeding to the checkout and payment process. For the convenience of the user there is a feature to wish list the items which enables them to save the items for future orders and they can access them any time and place the order by moving them to the cart for placing the order. While searching for the product the user might want to get the items according to the category. This will be possible by filtering by categories.

Thank you.
